The first thing that cannot be agreed with is that Nicolas Cage has not aged in 15 years, probably the atmosphere of the post-apocalypse has influenced him so much. Secondly, it's a twitching camera, it's like shaking the screen in a movie theater - a nightmare for epileptics. Thirdly, the operator does not know what a mise en scene or composition is at all - there is nothing beautiful in camerawork, there is nothing for the eye to cling to. Fourthly, it is very boring.

The slow destruction of the life of an ordinary man for reasons which were completely outside his control was well-conceived, well-plotted and well acted. Nicholas Cage's performance was pitch perfect.To an extent, this film can be seen as a satirical condemnation of social media fame and cancel culture, though that's secondary to the theme of mounting paranoia - both from Prof Matthews and the wider world.The fact that this film started out as a project of Ari Aster is no surprise, as it has much in common with Beau is Afraid - notably the hapless and powerless central character and some surreal and blackly comic moments.Then, in the last fifteen minutes or so, the film loses its way. A new element is brought in which pretty much undermines what had gone before. The result wasn't bad, exactly, but seemed to belong in a different film. I think it would've been better if the film had had the courage of its convictions and followed Prof Matthews to his logical fate.For all that, it's an interesting film, and I would urge you to see it.",Comedy, Drama, Fantasy,2000

Brown",594292,"Dave Lizewski is an unnoticed high school student and comic book fan who one day decides to become a superhero, even though he has no powers, training or meaningful reason to do so.",666,Gget ready for the new classic superhero movie!,"In a movie industry cluttered with own-grown hype, gimmicks and lack of idea, ""Kick Ass"" bursts onto the screen and shatters all expectations in it's wake. You're on this page because you think it's gonna be good? Wrong. Or you're here because you think it looks a decent or a good superhero movie to join the ranks of the ones you already love? DEAD wrong. Reason being, is ""Kick Ass""doesn't want to be good or above average, ""Kick Ass"" wants to be great and it has the balls to want to be original too. Seemingly impossible in a done to death genre where we've already glimpsed Mark Millar's signature style in ""Wanted"", but ""Kick Ass"" is all about the unexpected.Make no mistake, nothing you believe of this movie compares to what Vaughn and co. serve up for you. Mainly because everyone involved seems determined to honour the comic and redefine a genre. Most movies entertain, but this one? It wants to BLOW YOU AWAY! Less smarter movies have done that but ""Kick Ass"" ain't giving that up either. It's script is razor-sharp, dumping the pretension of ""the burden of heroism"" crippling even the better superhero films, showing this in actions rather than long drawn out emoting. Matthew Vaughn has finally solved the hurdle that all superhero movies suffer, namely how to get to know and love your characters without long drawn out scenes. He does it by keeping them moving. The more they do, the more they try, the more you know and love them. And make the narrative interesting and most of all relatable so we're with Dave 100% of the way, it doesn't just have to functional.The real visual joy of ""Kick Ass"" is it's desire to keep it simple but not at the expense of wowing us. Make characters do cool things, instead of Michael Bay-esquire things happening to them. That's why they exude coolness, despite Dave's almost humdrum existence. This is the everyman doing the things we could do if wanted to; not a guy from another reality or possessed with great drive and ambition. Dave wants to get laid. He wants to be hip. Even your bad guy in this is believable. Watching the whirlwind that is Hit Girl perform a routine almost straight out of Jackie Chan's Hong Kong days stuns us in a way no big screen chase ever could. Visually the film takes all the thing we DID love from the movies that ultimately didn't zing and churns them into a finely balanced flawless brew.Did I mention it's feel good? From it's inspired use of music (again utterly relatable) right down to it's outstanding score, like ""Get Carter"" for superheroes; I could say more but there's surprises in store.In a movie this stunning, acting is usually secondary (as any James Cameron film shows). Not a bit of it. In a cast as eclectic as the styles the film embraces you have performances that set a benchmark for all concerned. Can Mark Strong already better his stellar work? See his menacing and humorous turn as D'Amico, a career best. Christopher Mintz Plasse follows ""Role Models"" by breaking out of McLovin mode. His guy has layers and he can show them. Nicolas Cage as expected returns to his past glories playing larger than life eccentric characters but not without a little sadness too. Joining him is Chloe Moretz forever destined to be remembered for her first major role. She idolised Angelina Jolie apparently. Guess what, you trounced any action movie she has ever made! Moretz dominates any scenes she's in, no easy task considering her fellow cast! Aaron Johnson has the most difficult job of all. Being an original uber-geek after Michael Cera set the standard (anyone who's seen ""Zombieland"" knows it's hard to write an original geek even in a great movie). He shakes it, redefines it and OWNS it. He leads the movie like he wrote it, joined by a cast where even the smallest roles are fully fleshed out. It's quite an ensemble. A renegade band of acting styles forming a perfect one and complementing the film's fun style.Watching ""Kick Ass"" is ultimately like being on a thrill-ride, it doesn't just want to dazzle you, it's wants to draw you in, ride the wave and leave the cinema on a high. And it doesn't do that with gimmicks or tried and tested formula's, it breaks the mold, shakes conventions and wants you to be surprised while complementing all the movies you already love. It's not just a movie, it's a standard, one that promises to prove movies like this can be written with great heart and brain.And ultimately you'll be leaving the screen thinking ""Wow, let's do that again"" no matter how many agains come before it.",Action, Comedy, Crime,2010

The comedy was spot on, the gore effects were nice and extreme, and all the casting and performances were excellent, especially Cage, who was perfect for the role. I wasn't sure about casting Awkwafina, but her chemistry and character were a great compliment to Nicholas Hoult's character. But the best part of this film, was the nice twist on the over-done Dracula/vampire genre. It was a refreshing and unique twist on a story we've seen done so many times before. My only complaint is that I wanted to see more of Cage in this film. Not sure if it's doable, but this could be a fun new film franchise if they can come up with more films using the same characters - and hopefully see more of Cage at his best.",Action, Comedy, Fantasy,2010

Come on! I mean a 6.3?! People, this was a great movie that kept you on the edge of your seat with some of the greatest actors of our time: Nic Cage, John Malkovich, and John Cusack. The movie though went to Steve Buscemi! He is just becoming one of my favorite actors, but I'll explain later. Con Air is about these prisoners who have taken over an air plane meant to transfer some prisoners to other states and some are actually free. There is one person, Cameron Poe, who wants to stop this maniac, Cyrus 'The Virus' Grissom played by John M. from destroying these men's lives.John Cusack plays Vince Larkin, a Marshall who believes that Poe is on his side and wants to get this plane down as safely as he can, he does a terrific job, even though his looks aren't what I would've pictured for the part. John M. did a great job on scarring the heck out of me and was a terrific psychotic villain and Nic is so great as an action hero while he ""saves the *beep* day"", he also has this southern accent that is kind of funny but charming. Now, onto Steve who plays Garland 'The Marietta Mangler' Greene, this incredibly intelligent but insane serial killer who gives you a Hannibal the Cannibal vibe. His dialog is incredible and grabs you ""What if I told you insane was working fifty hours a week in some office for fifty years at the end of which they tell you to *beep* off; ending up in some retirement village hoping to die before suffering the indignity of trying to make it to the toilet on time? Wouldn't you consider that to be insane?"" He's funny in a way that wasn't meant to be funny and he just steals the show. Especially how he was singing ""He's got the whole world in his hands"" at the end when the plane was going crazy. :D These are remarkable actors, and yes, while the story is predictable and the stunts are over the top, nevertheless, I think anyone can enjoy this film an just have fun. It's a great action flick that deserves a look and a better rating! Come on, let go and have fun. Grab the popcorn, because you're going on a ride! 9/10",Action, Crime, Thriller,2020

You can't criticize a Snickers Bar for not being Creme Brulee. This is not High Art.

It's not a chick flick, it's not clever and witty, it's not deep and mysterious. It's a comic book brought to life on the big screen with nice fx and a decent score and appropriate acting. It's fun. It's a hoot. The bad guys are bad, the good guys are good-- and the end isn't a cop out which is nice. If you are not the audience for which this movie is intended, you will not like this film.

Funny that it took an Irish screenwriter to capture the Italian cadences.  These people aren't caricatures of Italians or any other ethnicity, they are just a vocal family.In another time, with just a few changes in the script, this story could have been high operatic drama.  But it's not.  It's a romantic comedy not a tragedy - even though it contains elements of tragedy - death under a bus, a lost limb, betrayal of marriage vows, and misinterpretations and misunderstandings.But these characters TALK about what's on their minds. You want to know where the Met is located? You ask your hairdresser.  You think your husband is flirting with another woman? You tell him that while you're both working behind the wine counter - in front of a customer.  You're mad at your brother, you want to know why men need more than one woman, you want your son to pay for the wedding of his only daughter?  If you really want to know, if you really want results or answers,  you speak up!
Besides movies based on Agatha Christie novels, it is rare that a story ends with bringing the entire cast together more satisfyingly than ""Moonstruck."" The morning-after-the-opera scene in Rose Castorini's  sunny kitchen with all the characters present is one that I can watch again and again.

The only reason this film did not receive a ten from me is the voice-over technique which was tastefully minimal, but, in my opinion, the only mistake the director made. It does help to provide closure, but I felt that closure was an unnecessary compromise here.This is not an entertaining film, and in truth, I am surprised by its popularity among typical audiences. It is a serious film, and a work of art, but fun is not to be found here. DO NOT see this film if you dislike feeling emotionally drained and ethically challenged, and DO NOT see it if you are very prone to boredom, or easily offended by sexual violence, substance abuse and the horror of daily life on the street. This is an intensely sad film about love shared by people who are caught in the gravity of their lives and can not escape. It is also a story of redemption and respect, found in improbable places. It is NOT a fun-filled frolicking romantic comedy, but rather, the opposite, and it achieves a beauty, dignity and power almost unique among films treating such starkly real and disturbing subjects.",Drama, Romance,,2000

A Grandfather everyone thought was dead is out to save his baby granddaughter from the clutches of a gang of devil worshippers. Thats the plot in a nutshell and you don't need to know anymore.This film is really a throwback to the old 70's revenge movies. The dialogue is purposely cheesy. The violence is over the top. There's nudity and gore and a few laughs to be had along the way. Nicholas Cage gives another fine unhinged performance delivering these cheesy lines like he was doing Shakespeare. Amber Heard as the sexy sidekick is just as good, but possible the best performance is from William Fichtner as the accountant.

Certainly the action scenes are well staged Â they are as grand and tense as the previews would have you expect. But Knowing really stands out from the likes of Next and various Roland Emmerich movies because of its heart (there is a profoundly human element amongst the chaos and destruction), and because of the surprising, riveting turns the story takes. In no way was it a generic ""save the world"" flick, like I feared going in. It is an original with a memorable ending that should not be spoiled, but it will almost definitely have people talking.In my mind, director Alex Proyas deserves a lot of the credit for the fact that the film is brave, and does not try to replicate a typical Hollywood blueprint. In fact, he even has Nic Cage back on solid footing, an actor I used to love but have been quite weary of lately. But I think Proyas deserves the main kudos for turning this into something creative and special, and I'd go as far as to say this it is his best movie since Dark City.There really isn't much to complain about regarding the film, but the one exception might be the middle, where the action sags a bit.

Of course, being concocted by Joel and Ethan Coen makes it even more surreal.As ""repeat offender"" H. I.

After returning to the same prison time after time under the eye of Officer Ed (Holly Hunter), he goes straight and they get married, planning to have a big family.  It is only then, he finds that Ed is a ""barren, rocky place"". 
So, what's a couple to do?This is where the ""Arizona"" of the title comes in, when they steal one of the quintuplets of the Arizona family.  Naturally, the father (Wilson) goes all out to find the culprits, even enlisting the aid of a ""tracker"" (Cobb), who is kind of an existential bounty hunter with a good nose.From this deceptively simple story line, the Coens create a dreamscape that is mesmerizing, serpentine, loaded with all matter of visual input, deft one-liners and characters that are so off-the-wall that it's hard to forget them and the situations they get into.Coen Brother stalwart John Goodman plays yet another flaky loon - this time an escaped con - who, along with his little brother (Forsythe) complain that the prison ""had no more to offer them"".Of course, the chases, fight scenes and getaway scenes are elaborate, well-choreographed and exciting, as well as funny.  How could they not be? This whole movie is one huge snowball rolling down the side of a mountain, growing larger and rolling faster as it reaches the end of its trip.But to try and explain this movie is an exercise in futility; you'd be better off explaining Kierkegaard to a room full of second-graders.

Scott Walker has made a very gruesome, realistic, deeply disturbing (at times) work that shows the rotten depths of a psychopath's mind (John Cusack, a real gem of the film), and his main antagonist, a National Guard officer (Nicolas Cage, by the way, a very decent play here). Then, there is a young lady involved in wild world of pimps, drugs and alcohol, and she plays a key role here, too. The plot is very straight and often blood-chilling, and the twists of plot can really mesmerize. In fact, the movie was a bit slow sometimes, but nobody in the audience left the theater, 'cause it was real thrilling. The spellbinding Alaskan nature is a real must see here, it simply leaves speechless with its sheer vastness and beauty. Great job of cameramen, though. The story is clear from the trailers and here the whole plot untwists slowly for almost 2 hours, but this is quite good, as the movie never drags.

As some of you out there who Private Messaged me in regards to my initial review posted on IMDb might already be aware, I originally gave it a rating of 3.5/5 stars, back when I was frequently contributing to the site. I passed on without much thought, considering it a disappointment and leaving my critique for those who cared to read it.It remains the single comment to have generated the most feedback for me. More than ""The Passion of the Christ,"" and more than yes, even my upsetting review of 2003's ""Peter Pan"" (which seemed to anger the small die-hard fanbase for the film that lurks on these message boards - by the way, I've had to clarify this sentence by adding ""for the film"" because someone PM'd me yesterday accusing me of implying I have a fanbase on IMDb...no, I am referring to the film's fanbase, so please hold off on the accusations). I digress. In summary I gave ""Adaptation"" a negative rating and to my surprise, perhaps because I avoided totally slamming the film, the fans responded to me with kind words rather than harsh ones; conceivably they too had initially taken a dislike to the film? I made a daring move. I bought ""Adaptation"" on DVD for ten bucks, thinking, ""I've got nothing to lose."" Plus, the front cover looked cool anyway.I watched it again (after taking into mind several themes and self-referential layers I had failed to visualize before) and was blown away by the originality and genius of the movie.My hugest complaint regarding ""Adaptation,"" originally, was its absurd ending -- I felt it was out of place, silly, and totally anti-climactic. Little did I realize this was the point -- to be a parody of the typical Hollywood blockbuster.There are so many underlying jokes, gags and self-references that the film grows better -- like ""Back to the Future"" -- on each new viewing. You're always finding new stuff.I found new respect for Nicolas Cage as an actor after my second viewing of this. I have always liked Cage despite the criticism he receives for being a one-sided actor; here, he proves he's capable of creating two very different human beings out of the same mold. Brilliant, Oscar-worthy stuff.All in all I got it wrong the first time. ""Adaptation"" isn't a film that starts out clever and descends into a messy and stupid finish. Well, actually, it is. But that's the point. I didn't get it before. Now I do.If you disliked this film, my advice? Watch it again. It knows a bit more about itself than you probably do. And read up on the message boards here a bit to get a clearer grasp of what's going on if you're totally clueless.P.S.

Another week, another Nic Cage film. Another trailer that seems to promise the lunacy of the Cage that we so deeply crave in our bones but will probably fail to deliver right? We have been burned so many times before.Well, I don't know what type of Cage watcher you are - do you tune in ironically, celebratory or casually? - but, personally, I am more intrigued and pleased by the man's choices and the man's commitment to picking, performing in and producing a truly eclectic slew of films on a mad variety of topics than I am, necessarily, by all the eye rolling, odd, wailing pronunciations and bizarre noggin follicle (hair) decisions... although I am here for that too.At first when Cage slipped out of the blockbusters and mainstream comedy dramas, that he made his name in, for the world of relatively straight to streaming/video, lower budget fair, I assumed - probably like most of you did - that he was just going the way of the Cusack or Willis. Keeping his hand in, pumping out a movie occasionally to pay the bills and keep the brand alive but his heart was no longer in it.Well, boy could I have been any wronger?!Cage's choices have seen him work across genres, with some of the most interesting directors and writers out there - trying to give each one of them a break as he does so (I'm sure) and while many will have written him off as someone people just enjoy ironically - and there are probably just as many who embrace this about his work - it is this mid-tier world - hovering somewhere between true low budget, homemade stuff and the bloated, computer generated, unsustainable, ludicrously budgeted world of Hollywood - that has given us the character driven, unusual idea driven, genre driven, script driven, weird cinematography driven and even taboo subject driven films that people rave about from the 70s, 80s and/or 90s (pick your recent ""Golden Age"" of choice) - you know, the ones that people claim loudly on Twitter that they don't make anymore.Being a website that is more likely going to review these kinds of films over a studio movie (because big corporations would rather spend millions on old fashioned, manual advertising than, hopefully, interesting, home grown word of mouth) I have been privileged to see and review a ton of these movies and while I certainly, often, approach them hesitantly, I have to say, I have been impressed more than I have been disappointed, over all.So, to Sympathy For The Devil, what's it all about then and is it any good?Well, actually, I'll save you any further waiting or suspense, I enjoyed the hell out of it.It plays out almost entirely as a two hander and so if you're looking for that film where Cage gets to give goofy line readings while, basically, spewing forth tasty monologue after monologue, with an appropriately ludicrous hair do and all the rolling, goggly eyes he can muster, then this is the film for you.But this is far from just a ton of enjoyable Cage grandstanding and not much else. The performances, the well written script and the superb, Americana, neon hued, cinematography help to make this taught, compelling, slowly unraveling thriller - with what, initially, may seem like an obvious conceit - rise above its slightly 90s straight to video style, Tarantino rip-off trappings.It's also one of those films that succeeds, with its conclusion, to impress you more than maybe it does while you're in the middle of it. Not that the twist is revolutionary or anything but it is neat, well played, and incredibly apt considering the title of the film and the way the narrative plays with the audiences shifting allegiances. What could have come off as just a clever but empty writing exercise, reveals itself to be storytelling as a fun, tight rope walk where either side of the rope it could fall into cliche or predictability.Between this, Renfield, Mandy, Color out of Space, Willy's Wonderland, Pig and the criminally underrated The Trust, we are living in a golden age of Cage... Long may it continue.",Action, Thriller,,1980

In 8MM, my coke had trouble going down. 8MM did not have consistent gory/violent scenes, but the way the movie was made made you fill in the blanks of what the makers of the movie could not screen. And if you pay attention and immerse yourself, you fill in more blanks than you really think you could, or want. As Max put it: ""the devil changes you."" The perversity and deep rottenness of the human minds displayed in 8MM is what disturbs you. Then you realize, that ""snuff""-movies are real, that there are individuals twisted enough to endorse/enjoy/take part in it. And worst of all, that these individuals don't look like monsters, they're perhaps just overweight nearsighted men who look like your dad, your son, your brother, even yourself. And if you don't look out,(no matter how secluded you think you are in your suburban home, with a wife, a daughter, and a dog named Shep) you dive into the pit of perversion and rottenness as well, finding no way out. In conclusion: excellent music, acting very sufficient, the plot: a must see.

Actually, some early negatives I'd read had me worried that I would be irritated I spent the money, instead I've already decided to buy this when it comes out.Overall, I'd say if you like romping easy movies like The Mummy, National Treasure, and Lake Placid you'll like this, plus refreshingly (without being sickeningly sweet) there is not one swear word or sexed-up scene, so take the older kids and Grandma. I thought Nicolas Cage was excellent, he looked great and can wear a leather duster better than most, and there was some nice chemistry between Cage and Baruchel. Alred Molina looked like he was having fun and is such an enjoyable villain. Baruchel does a good job - he is so geeky at times it is a tad painful - and I found myself rooting for him. The 2 main female characters are lovely and appealing personalities.More pluses: A lively pace and I never lost interest plus a fair number of laughs. Some interesting character twists with the oily young rock-star magician helping Molina, and some very funny cheeky nods to the original animated Fanatasia - watch for the nod to Star Wars. Great and interesting special effects that made sense when they were used. Even the way the actors moved when they were doing magic was very good (for some reason the wand-waving in Harry Potter sometimes reminds me of people using a flyswatter or shaking a bug off a stick, that didn't happen in this film).So no, this isn't some classic of cinema, it is what it is and is a bit thin here and there, but it's also quite good for a ""magical romp"" and is in no way a bad film or a waste of money. I could have done without the occasional background songs which seemed designed to emphasize romantic angst or appeal to young teenagers, but that was bearable. I saw this at an early evening show and there were not many people in the theater, but we all laughed and there was applause at the end, and we left the theater smiling. Personally I think the critics panning this are full of BS or are trying to prove what intellectuals they are. In the meantime see this with your family or take your friends, and then go out and get some ice cream and sit outside and enjoy summer. Hope they make a sequel, too.",Action, Adventure, Family,2020

Never mind that the acting is poor and the story weak --that was never the point. This film was made because DePalma knows how to make his camera dance and wanted to make a film based on that notion.A central question in most art concerns the role of the viewer. This dominated easel painting, then was the center of evolution of the novel and now sits at the core of thought about film. Is the viewer an omniscient God, or can the viewer be fooled like a person? Is the viewer a passive observer, or does she `walk' with the participants as an invisible character? So many clever questions.DePalma thinks the camera is a whole new thing, The camera is a type of character, part narrator, part actor, part god. It can lie, be fooled, search curiously, document, play jokes. So this is a film about the camera's eyes. `Snake' both because the camera can snake around following Cage, going places that Cage cannot, but also `snake' because the camera sees with forked tongue.So we have one seemingly continuous shot of the key scene, which is played first from Cage's perspective, then the fighter's, the Navy guy, the Girl, then the cop again, and finally the `flying eye.' Along the way, every eye trick DePalma can think of is woven in:--The girl's glasses are crushed so she sees less than the audience--The whole mess is about what a satellite sees--The casino has 1000 cameras which our own eyes coopt--The thing is framed by the TV eye--God-like, we scan over several hotel rooms while Cage and Sinese are stuck in the hallway maze--Splitscreen simultaneity--The whole thing is in real time, as if you were living in the actionThis is masterfully intellectual.

And seeing that it is in the hands of Hollywood in the form of big budget action vehicle it will definitely turn many viewers off. The recent highly contrived sci-fi action movie ""Deja Vu"" is also another potential unfair strike against this movie. But, be clear of doubt, this film is actually good and it succeeds in being intriguing and not cheesy at the same time - completely unlike the ""Deja Vu."" ""Next"" leaves a lot to the audience's imagination and certain things are there just for you to accept on the basis that this is a movie - no lengthy pseudo-science speeches here. The movie also makes very good use of computer effects - there aren't many and the few that there are, aren't awful looking like director Lee Tamahori's last feature ""XXX: The State of the Union."" Johnson's clairvoyance is shown in a clever way and the story takes several nice turns. There is the stock Hollywood romantic angle here, but cheesiness is mercifully spared as it is not over done, but actually played out humorously in certain scenes.Then the kicker is the ending, which I dare not give away, and it is a real breath of fresh air. It leaves you a lot to think about and that ultimately ends this film with, not a bang which many people might expect from a big-budget action-fest. No, definitely not a bang, but a hum.

Why? Because this isn't simply a ""New York"" movie, or a movie about a paramedic, or about euthenasia, despite the ostensible setting and plot points.Instead, Scorsese has created a cinematic myth about how haunted modern existence can be, and what it takes to be ""saved"" and find grace in a seemingly godless world. His vision of New York is all literate existential comedy, not a window into the rotten Big Apple. Mere satiric commentary on the tragedy of life in New York is for journeyman directors; Scorsese is doing something else entirely here.In other words, this is that really rare beast--a literate film that is, first and foremost, still a great movie. In the plot and its implications, there's more here of Flannery O Conner or Virginia Woolf than there is here of, say, Tom Wolf. More pariticularly, Bringing out the Dead does with masterful filmmaking what Joyce's The Dead did in prose. This film is a truly eye-opening investigation into how the living exist in the shadow of the dead and dying.The film accomplishes this incredibly difficult task on many levels--the cinematography alone should give you a clue that this is definitely not Taxi Driver or Goodfellas--there's something more sublime here (the beauty that American Beauty explains wonderfully is shown everywhere in this film, but Bringing out the Dead is less mundane, simple and ""character"" oriented). Every shot is right, and the numerous computer effects here--on display almost for their own sake in The Matrix--are here poetically put together by a master director.So, just for it's approach to a subject that few movies or directors would even attempt, this film will be a classic. Oddly enough, one of the few movies it can be compared with is Hitchcock's Vertigo, which confronts the same issues in a different way. Scotty's (Jimmy Stewart) desire to ""raise"" the dead is as strong as Frank's, and audiences didn't much like Vertigo when it was released either.The acting, the music, the incredible photography--they're all great, if you realize you are watching a literate, funny, well-plotted (as opposed to simply plotted) meditation on the ghosts that increasingly inhabit our technocratic dwellings.Too good for a grade: see it on the biggest, best screen you can while you can.

I cried when it was in the theatres in 1986 and I've seen it maybe 10 times now - and it gets me each and every time, as if I were watching for the very first time!  Sorry to drone on, but it has just the right touch - you've heard a lot of comparisons with ""Back to the Future"" - believe me, it isn't!  If you liked the two movies I mentioned in my header, especially ""Frequency"" since it is about to be released on video - you will love this film!Kathleen Turner was excellent - I have seen Debra Winger (originally scheduled to play the title role) in several films, including ""Terms of Endearment"" and though I respect her as an actress, she just couldn't have done this part justice.  Nicolas Cage was great in his role - the whiny voice was a bit much - but it's hard to believe he was only 21 when this film was made.  He plays a high school kid and a guy in his 40's equally well - he's always had a gift for that.  Jim Carrey - then mostly unknown - displays some of the physical slapstick routines that would later earn him praise and renown.  Then there's Joan Allen - as I saw this movie for the first time, I thought how much she resembled former first lady Pat Nixon in her earlier years - and sure enough, that's who she played in Oliver Stone's ""Nixon"".  Helen Hunt portrays Kathleen Turner and Nicolas Cage's daughter - ironic, since she is older than Cage!  It was one of her beginning roles as well.Without a doubt, the scenes with Peggy Sue and her grandparents are the most touching in the whole film.

It's about the developing friendship between Al (Nick Cage) and Birdy (Matthew Modine), but it's also about a descent into madness, and the lengths to which Al goes for his friend.The film starts in the late 60's, in a US military mental hospital. Cage has been seriously wounded, and has had reconstructive surgery on his face, but he's been brought in because Birdy is here. He's uncommunicative and appears to recognise no one, spending all day squatting on the floor of his cell squinting up at the window.The story is mostly told in flashbacks, either Al recounting incidents in their growing friendship as neighbourhood kids or, later, Birdy remembering other incidents. From the start the two are pretty dissimilar - Al is athletic, outgoing and popular while Birdy is quiet and introverted - a typical nerd. The two are, paradoxically, brought together by Birdy's love of birds, and the stupid things they do - making suits out of pigeon feathers to befriend more pigeons, climbing on (and falling off) factories trying to capture more birds.Al tries to set Birdy on a 'normal' track; they buy a wrecked car and fix it up, and head off to the beach. But Birdy is just too wrapped up in himself for this to work, and it's a wonder he doesn't alienate Al with his strange behaviour.In the 'present', the doctor is putting more pressure on Al to get Birdy to respond; if he doesn't, then Birdy will be written off and sent to a permanent mental institution. The flashbacks continue, and it becomes clear that Birdy's love of birds has turned into an obsession, and then into the darker realms beyond that.The final few minutes of the film cover a lot of ground; Al finally realises that Birdy is pretty well off the deep end; they both go off to fight in the war; Al gets his injury, while we see the incident that left Birdy in his present state. Meanwhile the doctor finally decides that time has run out, but Al decides he's not leaving.The ending of the film is incredibly powerful, and it should be a criminal offence to give it away. Is it 'appropriate' to the rest of the film? I dunno - but I thought it was pretty damn good.The film stands or falls on the performances of Cage and Modine - and, for me, it stands tall. Cage is excellent in his role, capturing the bravado of his character perfectly; but Modine is simply brilliant. During the flashbacks he portrays his nerdy character completely believably, but it's the way he handles the scenes in the asylum that amazed me. As soon as you know his obsession, it is crystal clear that he's not squatting in his cell, but perching, wishing to fly.Alan Parker has made some great films; this might just be his best.",Drama, War,,2010

A-,"Ridley Scott and Nicolas Cage deliver some of their best and most intelligent work in a few years, even if Matchstick Men is not quite either's great contribution for this year in film.  What they have done, from Eric Garcia's novel (adapted by The Griffins), come off rather entertaining, if anything else, and boasts much more thought than would usually be attributed to such a Hollywood film.  Nicolas Cage, who plays Roy, part anxious/obsessive compulsive, part sly con man, and part father to a daughter he never knew he had, is a main reason to see this movie.  His performance is on par with someone like Jack Nicholson in As Good As It Gets for watch-ability of a truly sad lifestyle, and while Nicholson's performance was and still is funnier and more charming, Cage gets so into his character, the little mannerisms that pop up more often than expected, that we feel for the guy even as his eyes get twitchy and goes over certain spots in his house like a detective.  He may be the most believable obsessive compulsive/con man you'll see in a long while.  Add then an outgoing, occasionally sneaky daughter (Alison Lohman in a performance that skillfully balances sweetness and irritability, sorrow and playfulness in a teenage girl) to the mix, along with a protÃ©gÃ©-cum-partner (a cool Sam Rockwell) who has a love/loathe relationship Roy, and there's the map work for an interesting, if here and there predictable, drama/comedy/crime film. 
Along with the performances, which are all above average (Cage could be deserved of an Oscar nomination come February, and Lohman could deserve the win possibly), is the visual framework that Scott pushes in each scene.  By getting certain camera tricks, and fantastic editing by Dody Dorn (of 'Memento' fame), the viewer can really get into Roy's head even in the smaller scenes, the ones that have little to do with the plot and only to do with the neuroses of Roy (there is even a little touch that I loved when Roy is waiting online early in the film at the supermarket, and the music in the background is an excerpt of the mental hospital music from 'Cuckoo's Nest'). This echoes the style that Scorsese used in Bringing out the Dead, also with Cage, in moving the film to get so into the mood that the story, no matter how intriguing and important, becomes secondary.   
Which brings me to my own personal beef with the movie, and that is the last fifteen minutes or so.  It was clever, up to a point, but as it unfolded, no matter how much I was still emotionally involved with these people, I felt that the twists (I won't reveal them here) undermined a lot of the rest of the film.  It will be based on viewer to viewer, but I just thought that it did a little too much to jab at Roy's lifestyle.  And yet, when I walked out of the theater, though I wasn't sure I had seen anything spectacular, I didn't feel like I had wasted time and money either.  Matchstick Men is witty, sometimes wonderful moviemaking.",Comedy, Crime, Drama,1990

Worst of all is the message its trying to send. Isn't it curious that the movie tried so hard to portray all of those that were left as bad messed up people? So is that supposed to mean that those who don't believe in the Christian God are all either cheaters, flirts, gamblers, thieves, drug addicts and just generally messed up? Because that's what I saw.

All characters, without any exception, are unhappy souls, surviving in a grim world, unable to improve their lives, prone to an almost genetically determined urge to mess things up. The image of rural America this film paints, is almost like that of a third world country. Most men have a cigarette in one hand and a bottle in the other. Dysfunctional families live in decaying shacks, without money or food. Violent dogs are barking everywhere. Disagreements are settled by fistfights or, in some cases, by bullets. The only community centres are a grocery store and a whorehouse. Homeless people are killed for a few dollars and a bottle of liquor. The central character is Joe, an outstanding role from Nicolas Cage. He is a loner, living on the edge of society, earning a living by poisoning trees so that they can be removed legally. He hires workers on a daily basis, one of them being a 15 year old kid who regularly gets beaten up by his alcoholic father. They get to like each other, but when the boy seeks Joe's protection, things get out of hand. The main characteristic of the film is the gloomy atmosphere, emphasizing the desolate hopelessness. The cinematography is stark and bare, with only the soundtrack adding some effect. The acting is very effective. Above all the part of the boy's father is worth mentioning. It is played by a local homeless man, who apparently died a few weeks after shooting was finished. Some reviewers compared 'Joe' tot 'Mud'. An obvious similarity is Tye Sheridan, who plays the same sort of role in both films, as a young kid who befriends an older man. But to me, 'Joe' had much more in common with 'Winter's Bone'. This film was also set in rural America, with Jennifer Lawrence as a teenager trying to keep her dignity in a world of violence and dysfunctional families.",Crime, Drama, Thriller,2000

The performances are so so. Cage plays the typical confused character he has played for the last 20 plus years. Nicole Kidman is all right and nice to look at but nothing else. Their daughter gives a solid performance. They were trying to include some references to the recession and its impact on the life of this supposedly wealthy family. For me, it didn't work.

At least we know how it ends and at least there's Google to get it right and Jaws to tell it better.",Action, Drama, History,2000

There is no other way to describe it.,"Seen at the Toronto International Film Festival Sept 17, 2009.First off it is important to note that the Bad Lieutenant name was imposed by producer Edward Pressman in the hopes of building a future franchise. As Herzog said, a better franchise would be based on his title Port of Call New Orleans. The combined title is a compromise which Werner Herzog was willing to agree to.Herzog was fun as always at the introductory remarks and the Q&A with TIFF programmer Colin Geddes. Telling anecdotes such as Cage asking him on the 2nd day of shooting what is his motivation and Herzog telling him not to worry about that, just go with ""Evil is bliss"" and sometimes ""let the pig out!"" (from the Bavarian colloquialism ""Die Sau rauslassen!"" / ""Las die Sau raus!"").I'll confess that I had my doubts about this one simply based on the BLt title alone, imagining that this was going to be some sort of embarrassing sequel that has been imposed on Herzog for some bizarre contractual obligation reason. Have no fear about that! This is a Herzog movie and a Nicolas Cage on-a-rampage movie with all that those both imply. Even if certain clichÃ©s of the genre are adhered to (the prostitute girlfriend, the father who is an ex-cop now ""drinking himself to death"", etc.) these end up having totally different plot resolutions than you'd expect. Cage's second scene confronting the matron lady and her hairdresser alone is worth the price of admission. I know they don't give Oscars for roles like this (actually, maybe for Denzel they did) but this is the best Nicholas Cage I've seen in years.Comment at the Q&A ""I have seen 20 movies at this festival, and this is the most entertaining of all of them!""

First of all, during this war it was a custom of both the Japanese and Americans to scream every time you shoot or get shot (even with about 30 bullets in your chest you can still scream apparently). Secondly, Japanese soldiers do not like cover. They like to stay out in the open, and will not fire their rifles unless they're within 15 feet of American soldiers. Thirdly, one man with a Thompson sub-machine gun can take out an entire regiment of Japanese soldiers in an afternoon.This film was completely first rate, start to finish. From the soldiers who flail about wildly as entire belts of machine gun ammo are pumped into them (before they drop to the ground mind you), to the 12 soldiers that Nicholas Cage shoots with a handgun while laying on his back wounded in the space of about 15 seconds, this film just screamed realism and authenticity. Highly recommended to history buffs and people who can appreciate some of the best acting ever put on film.",Action, Drama, War,2000

Its not often that happens. I heard from a unenthusiastic review (one of numerous scathing reviews out there, as anyone with the internet can tell) about the on screen shenanigans with Nick Cage and Ron Perlman were so enjoyable that it made the rest of the movie bearable. Going in with that anticipation, I found myself not only pulled into their characters' fun and convincing friendship but also into an intense and yes even edge-of-your-seat suspenseful movie. I forgot about my troubles for the day and enjoyed a good adventure.It was inspired, yes, by DnD, video games, and a number of other swords and sorcery books and movies that preceded it, but it is its own story. In a market saturated with sequels, prequels, reboots, comicbook diarrhea, etc... it's nice to see a story that is it's own, however simple.Yes it plays by the numbers. You know guys will die. Hell, you probably know who and in what order, if you've seen movies of it's ilk. You know there is a supernatural bad guy. And you know there will be one liners, oh are there ever one-liners! But the characters are fun to watch, even a little engaging. You may not want to see them die. I didn't. They weren't a group of scum with a bullseye for heraldry. The enemy was threatening and tricky, a real danger to our protagonists. And the one liners were, gasp, funny! Yes, even Nicholas Cage is worth the price of admission here. If this was ""just another paycheck"" role for him, he looked like he was having a lot of fun with this roll. And I don't know about you, but I like to see my actors have fun in a movie that costs me 9-12 bucks to see..It looses some points with me for the CGI. obvious CGI is obvious. But honestly the crispy gray CGI contrasting against a darker, colorful, moody lighting STILL didn't detract from the encounters or the climax. If you come to the movies to have CGI convince you that magic and demons are real, you come to the movies for jaded and asinine reasons. If you wanna see pretty visuals with a meandering pointless story, go see Tron. But if you wanna see a fun yet dark heroic adventure, go see Season of the Witch!",Action, Adventure, Fantasy,2000

Boy, I couldn't! The story was captivating from the beginning. Yes, it was very directed at kids, you know, the far off humour and such, but when I saw Toby, the genius' ""kid"", I felt that the movie was after all NOT just a Pinocchio rip-off where an old man made a robot-boy because he was bored or lonely... the reasons behind the creation of Astroboy were tragic and even mature. Of course, if you are a manga aficionado, you may be thinking ""duh! that's how's supposed to be"", but I am NOT. I barely watched a show now and then when I was a kid (I'm 36 years old... too young for Astroboy), so I wasn't really aware of the story. So I thought, well, this development has to be a fluke inherited from the original story, from then on it should go downhill... but it did NOT. The story is full of tragedy, though decisions that if you think them through you can even understand (like a father understanding that memories cannot truly replace his son), and redemption that may be obvious to superheroes experts, but are very well exposed to a new generation of kids that will witness a clear fight between good and evil (positive and negative forces) adorned with an excellent and adequate portion of comedy. Not just a kid's movie, but a movie that I will surely watch again when my kids ""force"" me to buy it and to watch it with them dozens of times. Go, Astro!",Animation, Action, Adventure,2020

Absurd. Ridiculous. Just plain stupid. These words usually serve to describe an incredibly awful movie that I try to forget forever and ever. However, some extremely rare pieces of absolutely crazy filmmaking are also characterized by the adjectives above, offering me the most entertaining time I can possibly ask for. An example of this case is Prisoners of the Ghostland. It's exceptionally dumb, follows a narrative completely devoid of any logic, and mixes up dozens of many genres by using different costumes, all sorts of epic scores, and character archetypes.Boasting an impressive production and set design (major Hollywood studios should be envious), Sion Sono offers the audience precisely what they expect from a film starring the maddest actor alive, Nicolas Cage. From the well-choreographed, well-edited, explosively bloody, hilarious action sequences to the infinite storylines, the viewers either accept whatever lunatic plot point or device the movie throws at the audience, or this is going to be a festival of pointing out what's wrong with the whole film. Prophecies, nuclear wars, zombies, samurais, cowboys... every generic development and formulaic characters we always see in every genre are present in this amalgam of pure chaos.As expected, Cage shines in another role that will probably generate thousands of new memes, but this time Sofia Boutella and Bill Moseley also deliver two captivating performances that kept me invested when Cage was out. The only problem I have with this type of movie is the balance of the whole craziness. I don't mind every single minute being packed with utterly ludicrous stuff, but when it starts getting genuinely confusing, that's when it becomes too much for me to handle. Nevertheless, as long as you keep your mind open and focus on the protagonist's main mission - and solely on that - you'll be able to enjoy this movie as much or more than I did.Prisoners of the Ghostland is everything a film starring Nicolas Cage is expected of being. Possessing technical attributes of making the biggest Hollywood studios shamelessly hide with envy, Sion Sono's movie is as illogical, absurd, ridiculous, stupid, and insanely entertaining as I hoped it would be. By mixing up dozens of distinct genres, the straightforward premise gets sucked into a world of total anarchy, where samurais, cowboys, nuclear explosions, modern cars, and much more collide to surround an otherwise simple narrative with nonsensically hilarious storylines and awesome action sequences. Sofia Boutella and Bill Moseley help Cage tackle this chaos, but the latter is the absolute standout due to his remarkable experience in crazy films. Despite it occasionally crossing the line and becoming too much for me to manage - it becomes seriously confusing - as long as the viewers are well-prepared to accept every jaw-dropping new development, fun is guaranteed with this brilliant satire.Rating: A-",Fantasy, Horror, Thriller,2010

In reality, it is a dark, scathing satire of American values. The marketing likely scared away a lot of people who would enjoy the film, while attracting an audience who was presented with something unexpected and perhaps uncomfortable. The comedy is quite raunchy, the tone is bleak, and the story is anything but formulaic, throwing industry conventions right out the window, which leads to a film that's more believable than most.David Spritz is a man whose life has become the ultimate exercise in futility. Each day, he wakes up and goes to a job that, despite paying a handsome salary, is entirely unfulfilling. His relationship with his ex-wife is strained, his relationship with his children distant. To make things worse, his Pulitzer Prize winning father seems to be disappointed in what David has done with his life.In real life, progress in one's personal life is generally made in baby steps. Usually, people don't undergo a drastic transformation over the course of several months. David attempts to improve his standing in life, at times failing entirely, at times succeeding in small doses. The results of these attempts range from very funny to downright saddening, and this helps lend the film an air of realism. This is a complicated character study about a man coming to grips with the fact that he's failed to meet any of the goals he set for himself in life, despite attaining a social standing that many people are envious of. There aren't any easy answers or life altering epiphanies; self-improvement is a long, gradual task that will probably never be completely fulfilled, and ""The Weather Man"" reflects this reality. While not for all tastes, this movie deserves credit for tackling a relatively conventional subject in a very unconventional, at least for a mainstream Hollywood movie, manner.

Considering he was also the producer, he should have just left it at that - and the small role he also had as a member of the cast (Barry). Was it too much responsibility for one novice filmmaker to undertake? Certainly. Was it a mistake to have him in this type of film as his directorial debut? Absolutely.The pace of this film was *very* slow. Had I played this at 1.5x faster speed, it may have been more enjoyable. His selection of the score was terrible, if not clearly absent in parts that it should have been present.The story itself, although done before, did hold my attention and I found it interesting, primarily from the only actor that was the most convincing, Nicky Whelan as Katie. Clearly she is the one that held this movie together.Now of course, Faye Dunaway's small role was performed on point, but that comes expected with an actor of her caliber. What was disappointing however was the rest of the cast, particularly Gina Gershon as Angela, and Nicolas Cage as Brian. I'm a fan of Gina, but I felt she struggled with her role in this one, just as Nicolas did, of which I am also a long time fan of his. I have to admit, this is the first film I actually wished Mr. Cage over- acted his performance as he is well know to do so in his previous films.What's more shocking is how these two seasoned A-list actors accepted these roles. I would assume after reading the script, it sounded much better than it was directed, so thus their lack of excitement and convincement in their roles I blame fully on the director.Had this film been directed by someone else, I feel it would have been a huge success and much more enjoyable.At the end of the day, Jonathan Baker can add an undeserved notch to his directors chair, Nicky Whelan can add a well acted and deserved positive entry to her acting resume, and Nicolas Cage and Gina Gershon should hide this notch from their actors chairs.A generous 7/10 for an interesting script, held together primarily by Nicky Whelan. It's a shame this film ended up as a lost opportunity to be much greater. For that matter, it's inconceivable.",Drama, Thriller,,2020
